This repository contains all of my code for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Now finally complete!

By nature, these are generally rather quick and dirty and don't do, for example, input validation. But they do work!

The more straightforward problems are generally not very commented, but for the more complicated ones I've tried to put in at least some comments.
